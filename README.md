# AI-Agent-Implementation-using-Model-Context-Protocol-MCP-
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an AI agent built using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The agent follows a structured context sharing and execution mechanism that allows it to process inputs, maintain context boundaries, and perform reasoning driven tasks in a controlled and modular manner.
